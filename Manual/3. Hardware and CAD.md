# Hardware

In 2024, a large part of the mechanical construction and hardware was carried out in collaboration with Pelle Evensen and Henrik Hörlin at FUSE, Chalmers. 

### Rear lid (svarv, genomföringar, radiella hål, skruvar)

A cylinder in aluminum with 150 mm diameter was turned to desired design.
Eight different penetrations were made in the rear lid by first drilling with a 9,8 mm drill. Next, one of the holes was threaded to 7/16 inch to fit a SubConn bulkhead of the same dimensions while the remaining penetrations were reamed up to 10 mm to fit M10 screws.
The penetrations in the rear lid are used for the following purposes:

1. Temperature sensor (M10)
2. Pressure sensor (M10)
3. Salinity sensor (M10)
4. Vacuum valve (M10)
5. Thruster (M10)
6. Antenna (M10)
7. Dropweight (7/16” 20 UNF)
8. On/Off switch (M10)

In addition, radial holes were drilled in the lid. With 45 degrees of separation, seven M5 holes and one M6 hole were drilled and threaded. A ninth radial hole was also drilled and threaded into M6, to mount the sacrificial anode. The radial holes were distributed using a dividing head at Microfabriken.

### Pump module (främre lock, aluminiumskivor, bälg, blåsa, pump, ventil)


### Aluminum rack (plåt bockning, skruvar)

Mounted on the rear lid is an aluminum rack that holds the antenna, the thruster and the magnet for the dropweight. The rack is made by cutting out 3 mm thick aluminum sheet to 15 mm wide strips and then bending to the desired shape. The holes in the rack are drilled to fit M5 screws.

### Electronic mounting plates (vattenjet, bockning, blästring)

To mount electronics inside the glider, mounting plates were created in 2 mm thick aluminum sheet. They were cut out with a water jet at FUSE and then sandblasted to achieve a nice surface. Finally a sheet metal bending machine was used to bend the mounting plates.

The PCBs are not directly mounted on the aluminum plates but are instead placed on acrylic mounting plates. These have been cut out with a laser at CASE.

### Maneuvering module (Vikter, stegmotorer, CAD)



### Battery module (Vikter, ballast)

The battery module was designed to accommodate space for one battery as well as space for ballast. On the sides, 12 steel rectangular blocks can be clamped, each weighing about 300 g. Furthermore, there are two steel plates with dimensions of 170x60x3 mm, weighing about 235 g each, which can be placed under the battery for additional ballast. 

### Antenna (Gjutning)

The antenna has combined purpose in that it provides communication via both GPS and Iridium. The antenna was placed in a molding socket together with a threaded aluminium bar and then molded together using epoxy. This ensures that the antenna is waterproof and that it can easily be mounted to the aluminium rack. In order to have a waterproof penetration for the cable through the rear lid, epoxy was once again used to make a potted penetrator.

### Dropweight (Magnet gjutning + målad, vikter, zinc)

The dropweight system consists of an electropermanent magnet that holds a cylindrical weight. To waterproof the electrical contacts between SubConn and the magnet, heat shrink tubing was first used around the wires. Next, a molding socket was used to mold the cable to the SubConn connector with epoxy. The magnet, in turn, was also molded in epoxy to be waterproof. On the magnetic surface, a very thin layer of epoxy was used to try to obtain as strong magnetic strength as possible. The magnet was later spray-painted black and lacquered for both aesthetic reasons and to have a slightly more durable surface. 

The actual dropweights are steel cylinders with 50 mm diameter. To prevent corrosion, the weights were treated with zinc spray, which acts as a sacrificial anode.

3D-printing have mostly been performed at CASE but also to some extent at 3D-labbet in the physics building and at Revere.
