# List over future improvements

* Make the planetary gear in metal (beware of weight distribution in the glider)
* Bushing for the weight package in the manouvering module
* Investigate potential leak in the pump module
* Print new parts in PETG (PLA deteriorates in saltwater)
* Remake manouvering module (can be shorter with a smarter design)
* Electrogalvanize the dropweights instead of using zinc spray
* New Grayhill 30-3ul switch connected to control system and dropweight
* Parallel connection of two batteries (ideal diode circuit with load switch function)
* Configure software to be able to measure battery level during use
