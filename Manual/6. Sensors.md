## Atlas conductivity sensor

### Calibration data

The following strings are exported after a calibration of the conductivity sensor on August 5, 2024. The calibration is a three-point calibration, where the first point is dry calibration, then low calibration with 18,880 $\mu S$ and high calibration with 80 000 $\mu S$.
