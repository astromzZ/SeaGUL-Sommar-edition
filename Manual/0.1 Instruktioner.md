#### Rear lid (svarv, genomföringar, radiella hål, skruvar)

<img align="right" src="./Bilder/Genomföringar.jpg" width="290" />

Constructed in cooperation with Pelle Evensen and Henrik Hörlin at FUSE. A cylinder in aluminum with 150 mm diameter was turned to desired design.
Eight different penetrations were made in the rear lid by first drilling with a 9,8 mm drill. Next, one of the holes was threaded to 7/16 inch to fit a SubConn bulkhead of the same dimensions while the remaining penetrations were reamed up to 10 mm to fit M10 screws.
The penetrations in the rear lid are used for the following purposes:

1. Temperature sensor (M10)
2. Pressure sensor (M10)
3. Salinity sensor (M10)
4. Vacuum valve (M10)
5. Thruster (M10)
6. Antenna (M10)
7. Dropweight (7/16” 20 UNF)
8. On/Off switch (M10)

In addition, radial holes were drilled in the lid. With 45 degrees of separation, seven M5 holes and one M6 hole were drilled and threaded. A ninth radial hole was also drilled and threaded into M6, to mount the sacrificial anode. 

#### Pump module (främre lock, aluminiumskivor, bälg, blåsa, pump, ventil)


#### Aluminum rack (plåt bockning, skruvar)

Mounted on the rear lid is an aluminum rack that holds the antenna, the thruster and the magnet for the dropweight. The rack is made by cutting out 3 mm thick aluminum sheet to 15 mm wide strips and then bending to the desired shape. The holes in the rack are drilled to fit M5 screws.

#### Electronic mounting plates (vattenjet, bockning, blästring)

To mount electronics inside the glider, mounting plates were created in 2 mm thick aluminum sheet. They were cut out with a water jet at FUSE and then sandblasted to achieve a nice surface. Finally a sheet metal bending machine was used to bend the mounting plates.

The PCBs are not directly mounted on the aluminum plates but are instead placed on acrylic mounting plates. These have been cut out with a laser at CASE.

#### Manouvre module (Vikter, stegmotorer, CAD)


#### Battery module (Vikter, ballast)


#### Antenna (Gjutning)


#### Dropweight (Magnet gjutning + målad, vikter, zinc)
