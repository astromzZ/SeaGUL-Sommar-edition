## Overview

he electronic system is divided into three custom-designed circuit boards, as well as several sensors and devices connected to them. The circuit boards are categorized as the "Control PCB," "Power PCB," and "Dropweight PCB." The Control PCB houses the microcontroller, SD card writer, stepper motor drivers, Solid State Relays (SSR) for the pump module, and a series of connectors for connecting the various system components. The Power PCB contains the DC-DC converters and outputs 24V, 3.3V, and 12V voltages. It also includes a voltage divider for measuring battery voltage. The Dropweight PCB technically didnâ€™t need to be a separate circuit board, but it was created to simplify the development of the circuit boards and expedite the completion of the other boards without a finalized dropweight circuit design. The Dropweight PCB controls the electro-permanent magnet through either a signal or a voltage drop in the 3.3V line. The different PCBs and their functionality will be described below. The electronics designs have all been developed using Autodesk Fusion, and the files can be found in the *Electronic files* folder, possibly containing minor changes from the versions that were ordered and implemented in the glider.

## Control PCB

In this section, the control PCB will be presented and explained, hopefully to necessary extent for future improvements and user purposes. Below is an image of the control PCB taken from Autodesk Fusion.

### Microcontroller

The control PCB houses an ESP32-S3-DevkitC-N8R8, placed in pin header receptables for easy replacement, that functions as the brain of the system. In addition to communicating with all of the sensors and controlling motors, pump and so on, it also communicates with the Atlas Global Tracker (AGT) module. The AGT handles GPS and satellite communication for the glider, and communicates with the ESP via a Serial (UART) connection. The pinout on the ESP can be seen in the figure below.

Some pins have specific names, and names for their headers, but many of them can be modified to be used for different functions. For example, the UART port can be configured and used as GPIO pins instead. Some other pins are directly traced to PCB mounted components, and not to pin headers, and thus their use can not be modified. An example of this would be the pins used for controlling the SSRs to the pump module. If any modification is to be done, it is advicable to follow the traces on the board in an EDA software, or in the images of this github manual, and make sure that it works as intended.

### GPIO header and other designated pin headers

There are som pins simply drawn out to pin headers on the circuit board, some which are designated for certain purposes and some unused. The GPIO header pinout can be seen in the image below

where the connections for the thruster, dropweight and UART are also found. The numbers refer to the specific GPIO pin number from the ESP32. Unnamed pins in the image are simply not routed and can be ignored. The UART pins are unused as of now, but could connect to a UART device or be used as GPIO pins. The dropweight header has a signal pin, GPIO2, for the ESP32 to trigger the dropweight system, and also a 3V3 pin which can be used if the dropweight circuit is configured to be able to release the weight in the event of power failure. More on that in the description of the dropweight circuit.

Out of the general GPIO pin header, some are used for specific purposes listed below:

- **GPIO10** is used to read battery voltage, and this needs to be done from an ADC capable pin (preferrably ADC1 since ADC2 can be limited)

- **GPIO11** is sintended to be used to enable the voltage divider for reading VBAT, but is not implemented right now as one of the tranistors used in that circuitry did not work with 3.3V (Explained more in the *power PCB* section) and thus it is unused currently

- **GPIO12** is intended to be used for the SOS leak sensor, but not currently tested and implemented.

- **GPIO35 & 36** are used as Serial (UART) pins in communication between the ESP32 and the Atlas Global Tracker. 35 (TX) is connected to SCK on the AGT, and 36 (RX) is connected to CIPO on the AGT. Note that RX on one device goes to TX on the other device.

- **GPIO45** is connected to the AGT AD35 pin and is used to "poke" the AGT, in order to wake it up and establish communication between the microcontrollers

- **GPIO48** is connected to the AGT D4 pin and is used to recieve a "poke" from the AGT, in the same purpose as for GPIO45.

### Stepper motor drivers

In order to drive the two stepper motors that are used in the maneuvering module to move the center of gravity of the glider, there are two DRV8825s mounted to sockets on the circuit board. Sockets are used for simple replacement. These are pre-calibrated with a VREF set to be
